look into Intergrals

place it rotates around = axis of rotation

L = angular momentum
w = angular velocity

T is torque, 
F is the force applied to the object,
r is the distance from the axis of rotation 

T = F x r * sin(angle between F and r)
[Torque = Force (cross-product) r(distance to axis of rotation) * sin(angle between the force and axis of rotation)]

total torque is the sum of all the Toque being applied


torque is essentaly a rotational force in the sence that it twists an object which causes 
it to rotate. 
The point where it rotates will either be a point its fixed to or its center of gravity.
